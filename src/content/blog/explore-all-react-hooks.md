React Hooks have been a game-changer in how developers write components in React. Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. This post explores the power of Hooks, focusing on the commonly used `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, and how they can make your code cleaner and more concise.

### Understanding `useState`

The `useState` hook is a fundamental hook that lets you add React state to functional components. Before Hooks, state could only be used in class components, but `useState` changes this by providing a simple and intuitive way to track state in functional components.

### useContext: Simplifying Context Sharing

### useContext allows you to consume context values in functional components without wrapping them in Consumer components.

```javascript
Example: Theme Context
javascript
Copy code
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { ThemeContext } from './theme-context';

function ThemedButton() {
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
return (
<button style={{ background: theme.background, color: theme.foreground }}>
I am styled by theme context!
</button>
);
}
```

useContext makes it easier to access context values, leading to cleaner code.

useReducer: Complex State Logic
useReducer is an alternative to useState, ideal for managing complex state logic in your components.

```javascript
Example: Counter with Reducer
javascript
Copy code
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
switch (action.type) {
case 'increment':
return { count: state.count + 1 };
case 'decrement':
return { count: state.count - 1 };
default:
throw new Error();
}
}

function Counter() {
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

return (
<>
Count: {state.count}
<button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
<button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
</>
);
}
```

useReducer is particularly useful for state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

useCallback: Memoizing Callbacks
useCallback returns a memoized callback function. This hook is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

```javascript
Example: Optimized Child Component
javascript
Copy code
import React, { useCallback, useState } from 'react';

function ChildComponent({ onAction }) {
console.log('Child rendered');
// Child component implementation
}

function ParentComponent() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
() => {
console.log('Action executed');
// Callback implementation
},
[], // Dependencies array
);

return (
<>
<ChildComponent onAction={memoizedCallback} />
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Re-render parent</button>
</>
);
}

```

In this example, useCallback ensures that ChildComponent doesnâ€™t re-render unnecessarily when ParentComponent re-renders, as the onAction prop doesn't change between renders.

Continuing the Guide
To continue this guide, you would add sections for each remaining hook (useMemo, useRef, useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, useDebugValue) following the same structure: an explanation, a basic example, and possibly some more advanced use cases or common pitfalls. Each section should explain how the hook works, why it's useful, and provide a practical code example to illustrate its usage.

Note
This guide aims to provide a fundamental understanding of each hook. For more complex scenarios and advanced features, refer to the official React documentation.

#### Example of `useState`:

```javascript
import React, {useState} from "react";

function ExampleComponent() {
  // useState allows us to track state in a functional component.
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initialize state variable 'count'

  // Function to increment count
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

import React, {useState, useEffect} from "react";

function DocumentTitleUpdater() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
