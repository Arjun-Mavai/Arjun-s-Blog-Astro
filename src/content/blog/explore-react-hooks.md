React Hooks have been a game-changer in how developers write components in React. Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. This post explores the power of Hooks, focusing on the commonly used `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, and how they can make your code cleaner and more concise.

### Understanding `useState`

The `useState` hook is a fundamental hook that lets you add React state to functional components. Before Hooks, state could only be used in class components, but `useState` changes this by providing a simple and intuitive way to track state in functional components.

#### Example of `useState`:

```javascript
import React, {useState} from "react";

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
